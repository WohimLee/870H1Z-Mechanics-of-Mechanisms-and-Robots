- Translation or linear motion
- Rotation
- General motion: neither a translation nor a rotation

## 1 Translation
Any straight line inside the body keeps the same direction during the movement.

&emsp;
## 2 Rectilinear motion

All the particles forming the body move along 
parallel paths.

These paths are straight lines.

&emsp;
## 3 Curvilinear motion
All the particles forming the body move along parallel paths.

These paths are curved lines

&emsp;
## 4 Rotation

The particles forming the rigid body move along circles centred on the same fixed axis
